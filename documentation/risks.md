# Project Risks and Obstacles

## Environment

- Using the Rust language inhibits prior experience from fully expressing itself in the team. Everyone starts from scratch. This can be a major concern when evaluating time management.

### Mitigation

- Due diligence must be exercised when evaluating beyond the scope of the current iteration. Triage and cost assessment must be done with peer review in order to avoid setbacks.

### Acceptance

TBD.

## Time Commitment

- Limited work hours are allowed per person. 6hr/wk

## Day Scheduling

- Everyone has different schedules. No consistent work days aside from meetings.
