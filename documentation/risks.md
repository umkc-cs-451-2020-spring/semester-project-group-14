# Project Risks and Obstacles

## Unfamiliarity with chosen tools and development environment

- Risk
  - Using the Rust language inhibits prior experience from fully expressing itself in the team. Everyone starts from scratch. This can be a major concern when evaluating time management, estimating feature timelines and choosing between implemntations

- Probability of loss
  - Likely

- Size of Loss
  - Moderate

- Risk Exposure
  - High Risk

- Risk Response
  - Concerted effort to adequately learn and become proficient in technologies used in the project
  - Constant commmunication in regards to learning hurdles or implementation issues that stem from lack of experience in the tech stack
  - Triage and cost assessment must be done with peer review in order to avoid setbacks.

## Insufficient Time Commitment
- Risk
  - Limited work hours are allowed per person. 6hr/wk is the given allotment which has the potential to constrain the number of potential features that we are able to deliver upon initial release

- Probability of loss
  - Almost Certain

- Size of Loss
  - Moderate

- Risk Exposure
  - Extreme Risk

- Risk Response
  - Plan features with given work hour allotment in mind
  - Utilize incremental development

## Underesetimation of the amount of required work

- Risk
    - The team as a whole might be underestimating the amount of required work in order to properly produce the number of features planned for the initial product release

- Probability of loss
  - Rare

- Size of Loss
  - Moderate

- Risk Exposure
  - Moderate Risk

## Inconsistent Availability

- Risk
  - Everyone has different schedules. There are no consistent work days aside from a couple of after-class meetings per week. Such circumstances do not allow for regular updates in regards to feature progress or reliable answers to when someone will be working on a specific feature

- Probability of loss
  - Almost certain

- Size of Loss
  - Negligible

- Risk Exposure
  - Moderate Risk

## Imptroper use of technologies and tools lead to poor implementations

- Risk
  - Everyone is starting from scratch in regards to many of the primary technologies that makeup the project's tech stack. This lack of experience and accompanying knowledge can lead to less than satisfactory implementations of solutions that might lead to substantial refactorings in the future or an untenable codebase.

- Probability of loss
  - Moderate

- Size of Loss
  - Minor

- Risk Exposure
  - Low Risk
